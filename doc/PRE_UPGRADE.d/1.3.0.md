We should encourage people to have a look at the [Changelog](https://fossil.kd2.org/paheko/wiki?name=Changelog/1.3) when upgrading to this specific version because there are major changes.

Take care, if you have installed some plugins, not all are compatibles. Perhaps you need remove them before this upgrade.
