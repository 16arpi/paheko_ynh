## Overview

Paheko (we chose the name Paheko, a word from the Māori language meaning "to cooperate", illustrating the purpose of the software: to improve together the daily management of an association) is software for associative management. 

It is the tool of choice for managing an association, a sports club, an NGO, etc. It is designed to meet the needs of a small to medium-sized structure: management of members, accounting, website, note-taking in meetings, archiving and sharing of the association's operating documents, discussion between members, etc. etc..
